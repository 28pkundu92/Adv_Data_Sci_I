**Gail score prediction from facebook profiles**

_Aim_:

1. Infer the variables needed to calculate the gail score for a woman based on her facebook profile.
2. Predict the gail score and estimate the uncertainity in it due to the inferred variables.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
